Python
  Simple
  Python is a simple and minimalistic language in 
nature
  Reading a good python program should be like 
reading English
  Its Pseudo-code nature allows one to concentrate 
on the problem rather than the language
  Easy to Learn
  Free & Open source
  Freely distributed and Open source
  Maintained by the Python community
  High Level Language – memory management
  Portable– *runs on anything c code will

Python
  Interpreted
  You run the program straight from the source code.
  Python program Bytecode a platforms native language
  You can just copy over your code to another system and it 
will auto-magically work! *with python platform
  Object-Oriented
  Simple and additionally supports procedural programming
  Extensible – easily import other code
  Embeddable –easily place your code in non-python programs
  Extensive libraries
  (i.e. reg. expressions, doc generation, CGI, ftp, web 
browsers, ZIP, WAV, cryptography, etc...) (wxPython, 
Twisted, Python Imaging library)

Timeline
  Python was conceived in the late 1980s.
  Guido van Rossum, Benevolent Dictator For Life

  M.D. @ U of Amsterdam, worked for CWI, NIST, CNRI, 
Google
  Also, helped develop the ABC programming language
  In 1991 python 0.9.0 was published and reached the 
masses through alt.sources
  In January of 1994 python 1.0 was released
  Functional programming tools like  lambda, map, filter, and 
reduce
  comp.lang.python formed, greatly increasing python’s 
userbase

Timeline
  In 2000, Python 2.0 was released.
  Introduced list comprehensions similar to Haskells
  Introduced garbage collection
  In 2001, Python 2.2 was released.
  Included unification of types and classes into one 
hierarchy,  making pythons object model purely Object
oriented
  Generators were added(function-like iterator behavior)
  In 2008, Python 3.0 was released.
  Broke Backward compatibility
  Latest version is 3.7
  Course will be based on Python3
